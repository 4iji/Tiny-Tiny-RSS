- Gmail-like labels for feed categories (needs UI thinking)
- "starred" label (+ unread, updated labels?)
- global search
- optional three column layout
- optimize rpc responses (e.g. now forceUpdateFeeds returns all tag/feed/vfeed
information, see if tags or feeds are required and return only them)
- email notifications (digest/single-email mode)
- per-feed update interval
- download linked images and store them somewhere in case the links get broken
- mark item as unread (maybe add combobox in view frame to mark as read/unread/starred)
