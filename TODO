- gmail-like labels for feed categories (needs ui thinking)
- optional three column layout
- email notifications (digest/single-email mode)
- download linked images and store them somewhere in case the links get broken
- mark item as unread (maybe add combobox in view frame to mark as read/unread/starred)
- catchup for tags
