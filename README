Tiny Tiny RSS
=============

Server-side RSS feed aggregator written in PHP and heavily based
on XmlHttpRequest and related technologies for user interface and
operation.

Licensed under GPL version 2.

Warning: I don't know how to stress it enough - please do not install
this program wide open to the whole internet. It belongs to (host or password)
protected directory on your webserver. There could be SQL-injection or other
remote vulnerabilities, so beware.

Version 1.1 adds experimental support for multi-user operation. This doesn't mean
that TT-RSS is suitable for large-scale open internet installations. It still
continues to be personal application, just in the looser definition, e.g. not just for
you, but for your friends too, who won't DOS you or try to hack in each other accounts.


Interface:

	There is (incomplete) support for keyboard navigation.
	
	"n" and "p" moves between next/previous posts when feed is opened;
	"r" refreshes feed list;
	"u" refreshes currently selected feed;
	"a" hides or shows only unread feeds in the feedlist;

Requirements:
	
	- Magpie RSS (http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) - place it into
	  magpierss/ subdirectory;
	  
	- RDBMS backend:
	
			a) PostgreSQL
			
			b) MySQL (InnoDB and server version 4.1+ required)

	  Example DB schemas and configuration are in schema/ subdirectory.
	  
	  For PostgreSQL don't forget to create database with UTF-8 encoding
	  (createdb -E UTF-8 -O owner_user database).

Don't forget to copy config.php-dist to config.php and edit it.

icons/ directory should be writable for your httpd user.
