= Upgrading TT-RSS 1.0.7 to 1.1 =

There is, unfortunately, no direct database schema upgrade script, the schema is just too different. 
Starred articles and feed subscriptions may be transferred the following way:

== 1.0.7 ==

 * Export your feed subscriptions to OPML
 * Copy xml-export.php from TT-RSS 1.1 tarball to your 1.0.7 directory and open it in the browser. This script exports your starred articles in neutral XML format.
 * Save resulting XML file somewhere

Unpack and configure TT-RSS 1.1. You may need to remove old tables manualy 
(or choose the different database, etc.)

== 1.1 ==

 * Import your feeds OPML
 * Run xml-import.php and import your old starred articles

== Q&A ==

=== Can I export all articles this way? ===

Yes, just tweak the relevant SQL query in xml-export.php (remove "AND marked = true").
