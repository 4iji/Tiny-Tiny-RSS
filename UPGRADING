Upgrading TT-RSS 1.0.7 to 1.1
=============================

Unfortunately, there is no simple database upgrade script, the schema is just too different. Yet, your articles and feed subscriptions may be transferred the following way:

1.0.7
=====

	* Export your feed subscriptions to OPML
	* Copy xml-export.php from TT-RSS 1.1 tarball to your 1.0.7 directory and open it in the browser. This script exports your articles in neutral XML format.
	* Save resulting XML file somewhere

Unpack and configure TT-RSS 1.1. You may need to remove old tables manualy 
(or choose the different database, etc.)

1.1
===

	* Import your feeds OPML
	* Run xml-import.php and import your old starred articles
