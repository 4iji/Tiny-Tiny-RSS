v1.0.3 (Sep 07, 2005)

	- OPML export/import
	- Support for simple content filtering (expression should be valid regexp,
	  checking is case insensitive)
	- Reworked preferences dialog
	- Added ability to mark posts as "starred". These posts are not expired
	  automatically.	  
	- Rework interface using iframes, fixes a lot of scrolling issues.
	
	- Rejoice, kids! Introducing support for MySQL (InnoDB and version 4.1 REQUIRED!)
	
	  Special thanks to Jamie McCarthy who basically shamed me into doing this.

	  Note: Database support could have suffered regressions from many changes 
	  in the code. I need your bugreports and yes - this means YOU! :-)
